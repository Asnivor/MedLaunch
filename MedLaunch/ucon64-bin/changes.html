<title>uCON64 - Changes</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><tt><br>
The original uCON for SNES and Genesis was written by Chicken &amp; chp in
1993-1995<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="190">1.9.0</a><br>
- completely re-written<br>
- this is the first real version with support for the most consoles<br>
<p>
<a name="191">1.9.1</a><br>
- bug fixes<br>
- fixed the -xv64 routine for receive and emulation on N64<br>
- cosmetical changes<br>
- removed the stupid curses GUI<br>
- optimized noisette.h for speed<br>
- added more OPTIONS and CONSOLE SYSTEMS<br>
<p>
<a name="192">1.9.2</a><br>
- started to add missing Sega System16(A/B)/System 18/dual 68000 support<br>
- -xv64 shows now the filename on the Doctor instead of "UCON64" (sorry)<br>
- removed -xmp3 option for SongBoy (latest information says that it will
  be a USB device with copyprotected MPE standard instead of MP3.. HAHAHAHA!!!)<br>
- TODO:  -xmp3 send MP3 file(s) to SongBoy (MP3 player for Game Boy)<br>
- removed options which were added by mistake (like parallel transfer for Z64)<br>
- added -ispad (looks for repeating bytes at the end of a probably padded ROM)<br>
- added -rn (some people might find it useful)<br>
- added -mg, -bin and 'show ROM' support for PC-Engine<br>
- added -usms for Jos Kwanten's ultraSMS an Sega Master System/Game Gear
  emulator for the Nintendo64<br>
- fixed aps (GRRNNNNN!!!)<br>
- added an universal frontend (in Java) for all platforms and all programs that
  need a filename<br>
- added CD32, CD-i and Real 3DO support<br>
- added -bin and -ffe option for Sega Master System/Game Gear<br>
- added database for NES roms (that enlarged the ucon64 executable by 190kb
  grnnn...) "You gotta do what you gotta do." (Futurama)<br>
- added -db and -dbv database commands... now everyone can check if the
  uCON64 version he uses has new database entries for a console system<br>
<p>
<a name="193">1.9.3</a><br>
- added -mka create APS patch support<br>

- removed (NES) support for bad FDS DAT files (by dbjh) If you really want to
  use FDS DAT files created by tools that erroneously include the header in the
  CRC32 calculation, use the switch -nhd. Someone with a complete FDS
  collection should create a new DAT file<br>
- updated (SNES) fixed crashing on first split file of Tales of Phantasia and
  Daikaijuu Monogatari 2 (by dbjh)<br>
- added (SNES) -xgd6 send ROM to Game Doctor SF6/SF7. This probably solves the

- added (SNES) -xgd3s send SRAM to Game Doctor SF3/SF6/SF7 (by John)<br>
- added (Genesis) -multi can create a multi-game file for use on the MD-PRO
  flash card. The downside: creating a multirom for the FAL doesn't work
  without -gba anymore (by dbjh; thanks to Enemy and acem77 for testing)<br>
- added (Genesis) -f can fix region protections, addendum files are genpal.txt
  and mdntsc.txt (by dbjh)<br>
- added (SNES) -id force -gd3 to produce a unique file name. This switch
  doesn't show in the help, because it "fails" for 130 dumps of the GoodSNES
  "0.999.6--" set. 128 IDs are each shared by 2 games, 2 IDs are shared by 3
  games (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (all) the patch generation options (-mka, -mki, -mkppf) use the

  acem77 for the feedback)<br>
- updated (Genesis) -mgd now produces proper MGD files (by dbjh)<br>
- added (Genesis) -bin convert to binary format. This option produces files in
  the format that uCON64 1.9.8-1 produces with the option -mgd (by dbjh)<br>
- added (Genesis) -xmd &amp; -xmds send/receive ROM/SRAM to/from MD-PRO flash
  card programmer (by dbjh and NoisyB with many thanks to timofonic and of
  course ToToTEK Multi Media for providing us with the necessary information.
  Special thanks go to Leo of ToToTEK for being very helpful and willing to
  answer our questions)<br>
- added (Genesis) -ssize=SIZE specify split part size in Mbit (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (SNES, SMS, PC-Engine &amp; Genesis) -mgd produces correct file names
  (by dbjh; thanks to acem77 for testing and feedback)<br>
- updated (Genesis) -mgd automatically pads files to the right size (by dbjh)<br>
- added (PC-Engine) -swap invert/swap bits of all bytes of a file. This
  effectively converts PC-Engine games between Japan and U.S.A. "mode" (by
  dbjh; thanks to acem77 for the information)<br>
- added (SMS) backup unit header length detection (by dbjh; thanks to acem77
  for pointing this out) This made a problem with the current SMS DAT file
  surface: some CRC32 values are the result of including a backup unit header
  in the calculation. Someone with a complete GoodSMS collection should create
  a new DAT file<br>
- updated (PC-Engine) auto-detection of bit-swapped files (by dbjh; thanks to
  Cowering for the info)<br>
- updated (PC-Engine) -mgd automatically bit-swaps the file if it is detected
  as being in Japan "mode" (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (PC-Engine) -smg automatically bit-swaps the file if it is detected
  as being in U.S.A. "mode" (by dbjh) I don't know if this correct. Please give
  feedback<br>
- added (GB) -logo restore ROM logo character data (offset: 0x104-0x134)

<a name="198-3">1.9.8-3</a><br>
- added (SNES) -xswc-super option to force 32 Mbit dump (by John Weidman)<br>
- updated (SNES) enabled -hi &amp; -nhi for -xswc-super, -xswc (dumping) and
  -xfig (dumping) (by dbjh)<br>
  You should explicitly specify the parallel port address when you use -hi or
  -nhi in combination with one of the mentioned dump options<br>
- updated (Genesis) fixed problem with -multi that caused problems with some
  games when run on the MD-PRO (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (SNES, Genesis, PC-Engine, SMS, Game Gear &amp; GB) -mgd now produces
  correct file names. This time for real! :-) (by dbjh; thanks to acem77 for
  testing and feedback)<br>
- added (SNES) -xswcr send/receive RTS data to/from Super Wild Card*/(all)SWC
  (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (PC-Engine) reversed how -mgd &amp; -smg work. -mgd bit-swaps a file
  if it is detected as not being bit-swapped ("Japan mode"/"unencrypted"). -smg
  bit-swaps a file if it is detected as being bit-swapped
  ("U.S.A. mode"/"encrypted") (by dbjh; thanks to kyuusaku for the feedback)<br>
  Note that if you want to play a game with an MGD2 on a PC-Engine that you
  have to manually bit-swap the file with -swap (or specify -int while
  converting).<br>
- updated (SMS) improved detection of SMS and Game Gear files. In most cases
  specifying -sms is no longer necessary (by dbjh)<br>
- added (SMS) -chk fix checksum (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (PC-Engine) it's Magic Super Griffin, not Super Magic Griffin. Thus
  the option -smg has been renamed to -msg (by dbjh; thanks to kyuusaku for the
  info)<br>
- added (PC-Engine) -xmsg send/receive to/from Magic Super Griffin (by dbjh;
  thanks to kyuusaku for testing)<br>
- added (PC-Engine) -f fix region protection (by dbjh; thanks to kyuusaku for
  testing)<br>
- updated (NES) -ffe writes correct headers for the NES games that actually run
  on the Super Magic Card (by dbjh; thanks to kyuusaku for the info and
  testing)<br>
- added (NES) -xsmc send to Super Magic Card (by dbjh; thanks to kyuusaku for
  testing)<br>
- added (NES) -xsmcr send/receive RTS data to/from Super Magic Card (by dbjh)<br>
- added (all) -pattern=FILE change ROM based on patterns specified in FILE (by
  dbjh)<br>
- added (N64) -swap2 word-swap ROM (1234 &#60;-&#62; 3412) (by dbjh)<br>
- added (SNES) -xgd3r &amp; -xgd6r send/receive RTS data to/from Game Doctor
  SF3/6/7 (by John Weidman) -xgd3r can currently only be used for sending<br>
- added (SNES) -gd3s convert emulator *.srm (SRAM) to GD BRAM format (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (SNES) added crack for Front Mission - Gun Hazard (by dbjh; many
  thanks to John) This crack is only necessay when the game is modified, for
  example by -f.<br>
- updated (SNES) added NTSC/PAL fix for Pop'n Twinbee (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (SNES, Genesis, PC-Engine &amp; NES) (dumping) functions for FFE
  copiers and Pro Fighter should work correctly with very fast PCs (by JohnDie)<br>
- updated (N64) added work-around for old bug in DJGPP and Solaris. Now -swap,
  -swap2, -v64 and -z64 work correctly for large files (larger than 8 or 12 MB
  respectively) when using the DOS or Solaris port of uCON64 (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (Genesis) replaced -pal with -region=CODE. Now it should be possible
  to create multi-game files for the MD-PRO that work on all three console
  types (by dbjh; many thanks to SamIAm for the info that brought me up the
  idea)<br>
<p>
<a name="198-4">1.9.8-4</a><br>
- updated (all) fixed 2 bugs in code of -pattern (by dbjh)<br>
- added (SNES) -xfigc and -xswcc option to transfer SRAM to/from cartridge in
  *Pro Fighter* and Super Wild Card copiers (by JohnDie)<br>
- added support for Linux/PPC (by dbjh; thanks to Tobias Pflug and Misty De Meo)<br>
- updated (SNES, Genesis, PC-Engine &amp; NES) fixed subtle bug in code of FFE
  dumping routines (by dbjh; thanks to Neill Corlett for pointing this out)<br>
- updated (SNES) implemented SRAM size display for Super FX ROMs (by JohnDie)<br>
- updated (SMS) fixed bug that caused -chk not to work for uninterleaved files
  with a header (by dbjh)<br>
- added support for Mac OS X (including libdiscmage) (by dbjh; many thanks to
  Steve Paige for his help)<br>
- added (SNES) -xswc-dm=MODE specify SWC dump mode (by dbjh)<br>
- removed (SNES) -xswc-super, use -xswc -xswc-dm=1 instead (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (all) uCON64 won't accept a parallel port address without using --port
  anymore (by dbjh)<br>
  This used to be possible:<br>
  ucon64 &#60;transfer option&#62; &#60;rom&#62; &#60;parallel port address&#62;<br>
  Now you should use a command like this:<br>
  ucon64 &#60;transfer option&#62; &#60;rom&#62; --port=&#60;parallel port address&#62;<br>
  Or of course, if uCON64 automatically detects the right port or if you have
  specified the correct port in the configuration file, a command like this:<br>
  ucon64 &#60;transfer option&#62; &#60;rom&#62;<br>
  This change removes the requirement of specifying the parallel port address
  when using additional command line options (switches) like -xfalm or -xswc-dm.
  It also prevents uCON64 from accessing I/O ports not associated to the
  parallel port if you specify additional transfer switches while &#60;rom&#62;
  has a name that starts with a number<br>
- updated (SNES, Genesis, PC-Engine, SMS, Game Gear &amp; GB) -mgd produces
  correct index files (MULTI-GD) (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (SNES &amp; Genesis) -s produces an index file if the ROM dump is in
  MGD format (by dbjh)<br>
- added support for ppdev (GNU/Linux-only) (by dbjh)<br>
  This solves two problems:<br>
  1.) It's no longer necessary for uCON64 to be setuid root in order to
  communicate with a backup unit. Just make sure /dev/parport&#60;n&#62; has the
  right permissions or get yourself added to the correct group<br>
  2.) Non-standard parallel port addresses do not have to be specified. uCON64
  still uses the first parallel port by default. It's possible to override that
  by setting parport_dev in the configuration file or by setting an environment
  variable<br>
  Use the configure option --enable-ppdev to enable the code<br>
- added (all) -md5 calculate MD5 checksum of ROM (by NoisyB)<br>

  (transfer ROM data), -xf2ac=N (dump N Mbits), -xf2as (transfer 256 kB of SRAM
  data) and -xf2ab=BANK (transfer 64 kB of SRAM data to "bank" BANK) (by NoisyB
  and dbjh, based on source code of Ulrich Hecht and David Voswinkel; many
  thanks to David Voswinkel for testing the parallel port code)<br>
- added (GBA) -xf2amulti=SIZE send multiple ROMs to the F2A. You should not
  specify a loader file on the command line as a file argument. Specify one in
  the configuration file or set an environment variable (by dbjh)<br>
- added (SNES) -dnsrt restore name, region and checksum from NSRT header and
  remove it (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (SNES) fixed shameful bug that caused -chk and -n not to work
  correctly for interleaved ROM dumps (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (SNES) added/updated code to dump special-chip cartridges. Now it's
  possible to dump Super FX (2), S-DD1, SA-1 and SPC7110 cartridges, but see the
  comment in swc.c! (by JohnDie)<br>
- updated (SNES) made -xswc-dm active for -xswcc so that SRAM data can be
  transferred to and from Super FX 2 cartridges (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (SNES) renamed -xswc-dm to -xswc-io, because it can also be used for
  sending an SRAM file (by dbjh)<br>
- updated (GBA) made -xfalmulti use gbaloader to be consistent with -xf2amulti.
  So, don't specify a loader as file argument anymore (by dbjh)<br>
